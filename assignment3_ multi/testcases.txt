For the following:
memory 200
stacksize 50
fitType 0

TC0
Let timeSlice be 500
load prog2
load prog0
load prog0
step 1
jobs
output:
<PCB prog0>
<PCB prog0>
Purpose: tests what the program does when a process halts during a
timeslice. And proves that our program doesnt run the next process
once a program has finished during a timeSlice. Also tests whether the
program round robins a finished program

TC1
Let timeSlice be 2
load prog2
load prog0
load prog0
step 1
jobs
output:
<PCB prog0>
<PCB prog0>
<PCB prog2>
Purpose: tests what the program does when a process doesnt halt during
a timeslice. also proves that round robin works.

TC2
Let timeSlice be 2
load prog0
load prog1
step 1
step 1
cpu
step 1
cpu
Purpose: tests whether context switching works.
