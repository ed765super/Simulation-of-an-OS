	     APPLE
Expect: oneString: billy
	twoString: APPLE
	Three String = billyAPPLE
	Upper case oneString = BILLY
	fourString with uppercase oneString twice and B, except first
	four characters = YBILLYB with 7 characters

Name: test2
Purpose: test the function's ability to deal with an IS where the
first and second strings are a mixture of capital and lowercase
letters
IS contains: BiLlY
   	     aPpLE
Expect: oneString: Billy
	twoString: aPpLE
	Three String = BiLlYaPpLE
	Upper case oneString = BILLY
	fourString with uppercase oneString twice and B, except first
	four characters = YBILLYB with 7 characters

Name: test3
Purpose: This test is to see what the program will do when the first

   	     doggy
Expect: oneString: Hello
	twoString: doggy
	Three String = Hellodoggy
	oneString equal to fixedString = Hello

Name: test4

   	     happy
Expect:	oneString: dog
	twoString: happy
	Three String = doghappy
	Four String = dogA

Name: test5
Purpose: Checks what the member function removefirst will do when the
number of elements in fourstring is less than 4
IS contains: d
   	     
Expect: Three String = d
	Upper case oneString = D
	fourString with uppercase oneString twice and B, except first
	four characters =  with 0 characters

Name: test6
Purpose: tests what the program will do when the IS contains non
alphabetical characters.in this particular test, the first string is
equal to the second string
IS Contains: *\s!@#\t^&
   	     123
Expect: Three String = *\s!@#\t^&123
	Upper case oneString = *\s!@#\t^&
	fourString with uppercase oneString twice and B, except first
	four characters = *\s!@#\t^&B with 9 characters

Name: test7
Purpose: tests what the program will do when the IS contains non
alphabetical characters. in this particular test, the first string is
less than the second string
IS Contains: $%
   	     123
