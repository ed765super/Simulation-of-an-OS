1) there can be one optional command line argument, an integer
FileSysSize > 0.

2) If there is no command line argument, the default value for
FileSysSize should be 16. 

3) the maximum length of a file or directory name is 18
characters.

3.5) the root directory will always be named "/"

4) file and directory names are case-sensitive and are made up of
alpha-numeric characters & the '.' character only.

Note: for assumption #5 any and all parameters surrounded by '[]' are
optional.
5) valid cmds must be lowercase. the following are valid: format,
defrag, pwd, ls [< path to directory >], cd [< path to directory >],
mkdir < path to directory >, rm < path to file > , rmdir < path to
directory >, cp ['>' | '<'] < path to a file > < path to a file or
directory >, cat [h] < path to a file >, displayInode [< n > < m >],
du [< path to directory >], & exit

6) path stands for an absolute path or a relative path. If the path
begins with "/", then it is an absolute path. If the specified path is
not a valid directory, then a suitable error message should be
displayed. Use ".." to denote the parent directory and "." to denote the present
directory. "/" will be used to separate names in a path.

7) For ls, If no parameter is given, it is assumed that you want the
contents of the present working directory to be listed. If the
specified path is not a valid directory, then it is assumed that you
want a suitable error message to be displayed on the terminal. 

8) For cd, If no parameter is given, it is assumed that you want to
change the present working directory to the root directory. If the
specified path is not a valid directory, then it is assumed that you
want a suitable error message to be displayed on the terminal.

9) For mkdir If any intermediate directory within the path of the parameter for
mkdir does not exist, then it is assumed that you
want a suitable error message to be displayed on the terminal.

10) For rm, If the path you type ends in the character '*', then it is
assumed that you want all the files in the directory at the end of the
path to be removed. Note that '*' must only be at the end of the path
specification.

11) For cp, The file specified (as an absolute or relative path) by
the first parameter is the source and the file specified (as an
absolute or relative path) by the second parameter is the destination.

11.25) If the second parameter is a path to a directory, then it is
assumed that you want the file  copied as a file retaining the file
name to the directory specified in the second parameter.

11.50) If the destination is a filename for a file that exists, then
it is assumed that you want the file to be overwritten. 

11.75) If the specified path is not valid, then it is assumed that you
want a suitable error message to be displayed on the terminal.

11.8) If the optional parameter is the character '<', then it is
assumed that you want the source to be treated as a path in the Linux
file system, and the destination as a path in the simulated file
system.

11.85) If the optional parameter is the character '>', then it is
assumed that you want the source to be treated as a path in the simulated
file system, and the destination as a path in the Linux file system.

11.98) If neither '<' or '>' is typed, it is assumed you want both
source and destination to be treated as paths in the simulated
file system.

12) for displayInode, the optional parameters n & m must be integers. If no
parameters are given it is assumed you want all the
inodes to be displayed.

13) For du, If no parameter is given it is assumed you want the size
of the present working directory to be printed.

FUNCTIONALLITY:
I have a file called testSetData that proves that i am masking the hexadecimals
and shifting them correctly.

exit & displayInode works.

the program writes the first line of a node correctly.

the program writes to the disk in correct form.
